The primary data products will be accessible through the Rubin Science Platform (RSP), a web-based portal. The RSP will provide a suite of tools for querying the database, visualizing images, and performing scientific analysis.

Data will be released in annual data releases. After a proprietary period for scientists in the US and Chile, all data products will become fully public to the world.
