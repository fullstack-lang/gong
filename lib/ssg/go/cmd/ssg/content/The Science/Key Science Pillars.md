The LSST is designed to make transformative discoveries in four key areas:

1.  **Dark Energy and Dark Matter:** By observing billions of galaxies, the LSST will map the distribution of dark matter and measure the effects of dark energy on the expansion of the universe.
2.  **Solar System Inventory:** The survey will catalog millions of small bodies in our solar system, from near-Earth asteroids to distant Kuiper Belt objects.
3.  **The Transient Sky:** Rubin Observatory will detect billions of transient events, such as supernovae, variable stars, and potentially new and unexpected phenomena.
4.  **Milky Way Mapping:** The LSST will provide a detailed map of the structure and evolution of our own galaxy, the Milky Way.
