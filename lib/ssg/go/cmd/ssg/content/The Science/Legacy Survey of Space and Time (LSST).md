The LSST is a planned 10-year survey of the southern sky that will take place at the Vera C. Rubin Observatory. It will image the sky over and over again, producing a time-lapse movie of the universe.

The survey is expected to generate approximately 20 terabytes of data per night, leading to a total database of over 15 petabytes by the end of the survey. This "Big Data" challenge requires sophisticated data management and processing techniques.
