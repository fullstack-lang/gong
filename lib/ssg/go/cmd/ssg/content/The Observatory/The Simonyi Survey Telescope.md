The heart of the Rubin Observatory is the Simonyi Survey Telescope, an 8.4-meter telescope with a unique three-mirror design. This design provides a very wide 3.5-degree field of view, allowing it to survey the entire available sky in just a few nights.

Key features include:
- A large aperture to collect significant light.
- A compact design to enable rapid slewing and repositioning.
- A state-of-the-art active optics system to maintain image quality.
