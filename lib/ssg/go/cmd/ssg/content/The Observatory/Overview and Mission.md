The Vera C. Rubin Observatory, formerly known as the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), is an astronomical observatory currently under construction in Chile. Its main task is to carry out a ten-year survey of the southern sky, the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST).

The mission is to build a well-understood and calibrated system that will produce a vast astronomical dataset for a broad range of scientific investigations. The observatory is designed to address four main science areas:

1.  Probing Dark Energy and Dark Matter.
2.  Taking an inventory of the Solar System.
3.  Exploring the transient optical sky.
4.  Mapping the Milky Way.
