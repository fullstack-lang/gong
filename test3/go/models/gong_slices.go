// EvictInOtherSlices allows for adherance between
// the gong association model and go.
//
// Says you have a Astruct struct with a slice field "anarrayofb []*Bstruct"
//
// go allows many Astruct instance to have the anarrayofb field that have the
// same pointers. go slices are MANY-MANY association.
//
// With gong it is only ZERO-ONE-MANY associations, a Bstruct can be pointed only
// once by an Astruct instance through a given field. This follows the requirement
// that gong is suited for full stack programming and therefore the association
// is encoded as a reverse pointer (not as a joint table). In gong, a named struct
// is translated in a table and each table is a named struct.
//
// EvictInOtherSlices removes the fields instances from other
// fields of other instance
//
// Note : algo is in O(N)log(N) of nb of Astruct and Bstruct instances
